# Nakioku
Ocean of lost memories

https://www.nakioku.com/

Trying to create a website to post updates on all projects involving the characters and world of Nakioku.

WIP Roadmap / Plan I guess
-----------------------------------
Home Page

- Create a header that allows visitors to access other pages
- Below the header have a box linking visitors to new content in a different page, include some text at the bottom stating when the content was added
- If the content is in a different page, bring the visitor to that page (unless it's a video)
- Something something Current Status, Calendar

Music Page

- For official music, create a visual with the disc asset but make it rotato
- Some way to play the music on the website by playing an mp3
- Some way for visitors to listen to the music elsewhere
- Create a hidden button linking vistors to Concept Music
- Categorize official music & concept music with which world the songs are meant for.


Gallery Page

- Categorize art for individual characters based off of which world they're in
- Hidden button for Concept Art
